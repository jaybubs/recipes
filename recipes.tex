\subsubsection{Procedure}%
Open a can of the high quality beer or the wine and start drinknig. If your knives ain't sharp now is a good time to give them some treatment before the alcohol kicks in.\par
Put the pot on your stove and set that fucker to minimum flame/heat. Chuck in the block of butter and let it slowly melt.\par
In the meantime prep your chopping board area and start with the onions - chop'em up into tinycubes and chuck'em into the melting butter, lid it, and gently increase the temperature.\par
Next crush the garlic bulb. At this point decide whether you wanna chop it up into tiny bits or just crush them with the side of the knife (preferred method). Bonus points if you keep the peel on for dat dere extra fibre (srs). Chuck that shit in.\par
While the onion/garlic combo is frying in the butter soup, start chopping up the meat into nice big cubey chunks. Once you're done check on the garlnion mixture - when it's a bit foamy and yellowy, that's the perfect time to chuck all the meat in.\par
Now grab the salt and pepper and grind that shit all over the delicious meat. Keep grinding, make sure it's really rich, don't be a goddamn wuss, more salt. And a bit more pepper ffs. Got it? Great, now a dib more of both and cover it up. Now Start a timer for 15 minutes.\par
Great job, take another big sip of your delicious beer/wine.\par
Drink faster cos now you got about 15 minutes to dice the tomatoes and peppers - feel free to go chunky or fine according to your preference. Set these aside. Once the timer goes wild check the meat and give it a big big big stir, then cover it up again and time another 5 minutes. Now if you were fast enjoy the next 5 minutes with more of your delicious beer/wine. Otherwise keep dicing ffs, you only have 5 minutes left. Jesus.\par
Time's up chuck that tomato and pepper shit in! If your alcoholic ingredient is hard liquor this is the time to chuck it in, otherwise hold back. Set the timer for 15 minutes and cover that sucker up.\par
In the meantime prep your herbs, grab a couple of soup spoons of your primary herb, a soup spoon of your secondary herb and whatever amount of chillies you think your arse can handle. 10 minutes left? keep drinking ffs\par
Timer went off? whachu waiting for, chuck those herbs in. And now is also the time you chuck in the beer or wine. Even if you're going for full beer goulash, chuck in only 0.5 l at this point. Set the timer for 45 minutes and lower the heat.\par
Now that you have plenty of time to drink, maybe open a second can or grab another full glass of wine. It's time to get dicing all the other veg, so go ahead. Once you're done, figure out what you want to watch, you should have at least 20 minutes to find a movie or a show or something.\par
Once time's up, chuck all that shit in and fill the pot up with water (or the other can of beer) so all the veg is covered. Stir that shit, and set a timer for 1 hr, no less.\par
If you're efficent you should have chosen a thing to watch by now, might as well start.\par
When time's up, taste that fucker and decide whether it needs any more (it shouldn't, but in case you fucked it up).\par
Serve that shit piping hot, bonus points for topping your bowl with grated mozzarella.\par
\par
Enjoy!
